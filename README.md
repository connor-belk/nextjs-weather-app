## Weather App Created as a practice Next.js project.

- Deployed App can be found here:

- Using the OpenWeatherMap API, I followed a video (GH:fireclint|YT:Code Commerce) and created a project to find basic weather data by city name.

  - Shown on screen is the sky condition, current temperature, feels-like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and wind direction.
  - This is used with the free level of OpenWeatherMap. So, if it is not working, its probably because I reached my limit on API requests.

- To search:

  - Type city into search bar (No state or country needed)
    - I understand this will potentially give the wrong city data; I am still in the process of **over-building** this app.
  - Press ENTER or click the search icon.
  - And BOOM! There ya go. Weather information at the press of a button.

- Let me know how I did. Give me suggestions for future features!

(This is my first _real_ project that I actually deployed.)
